## How can we represent a Mastermind board game? (state of an object)

1. The `generate_puzzle` function takes a list of `colors` and the number of `positions` as inputs. It uses the `random.choices` function to generate a random combination of colors with the specified number of positions. The function returns the generated puzzle.

2. The `evaluate_guess` function takes the `puzzle` (the secret code) and the `guess` as inputs. It compares each element of the `guess` with the corresponding element of the `puzzle`. If the positions match, it adds a `*` to the result string. If the color is present in the puzzle but in a different position, it adds an `o` to the result string. Otherwise, it adds a space `' '`. The function returns the result string representing the clues.

3. The `play_game` function takes `colors`, `positions`, and `max_rounds` as inputs. It starts by generating a random puzzle using the `generate_puzzle` function. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the maximum number of rounds is reached.

4. Within each round, the player is prompted to enter their guess using the `input` function. The guess is trimmed to the specified number of positions. The guess is then evaluated using the `evaluate_guess` function, and the resulting clues are printed.

5. If the guess is an exact match to the puzzle (indicated by `clue == '*' * positions`), the player wins and a congratulatory message is printed along with the number of rounds taken to solve the puzzle. The function then returns.

6. If the maximum number of rounds is reached without the player solving the puzzle, a game-over message is printed along with the correct puzzle combination.

7. Finally, the `play_game` function is called with the specified `colors`, `positions`, and `max_rounds` to start the game.

## What are some operations associated with this game? (operations associated with an object)

1. Generating a puzzle: The `generate_puzzle()` function randomly selects colors from a given list to create a puzzle.

2. Evaluating a guess: The `evaluate_guess()` function compares the player's guess with the puzzle and provides clues in the form of `*` for correct color and position, `o` for correct color but wrong position, and a space for incorrect color.

3. Playing the game: The `play_game()` function initializes the game by generating a puzzle. It prompts the player to make a guess, evaluates the guess using `evaluate_guess()`, and provides feedback. The game continues until the player solves the puzzle or reaches the maximum number of rounds.

## Think what things users can do with the game and we make public methods for users to call to do those things

1. **setup_game(colors, positions, max_rounds)**: Allows users to customize the game parameters such as the number of colors, positions, and maximum rounds.

2. **play_game()**: Initiates the gameplay loop and allows users to play the game.

3. **get_game_state()**: Retrieves the current game state, including the puzzle, the number of rounds played, and the maximum number of rounds.

4. **dump_game_state()**: Prints the game state to the console after the game ends, displaying the final puzzle and other relevant information.

## Think what are some internal operations the game must perform and we make private methods for them

1. `generate_puzzle`: Generates a random puzzle by selecting colors from a given list.

2. `evaluate_guess`: Compares the user's guess with the correct puzzle and provides a clue indicating the correctness of colors and positions.

3. `play_game`: Orchestrates the game by generating a puzzle, prompting the user for guesses, evaluating the guesses, and determining the game outcome.

The code allows users to play the game by making guesses and receiving clues. It tracks the number of rounds and terminates the game when the puzzle is solved or the maximum number of rounds is reached. The code covers basic internal operations such as getting and displaying hints, determining the game's completion, and displaying the correct puzzle if the game ends without solving it.
