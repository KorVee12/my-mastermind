## How can we represent a Mastermind board game? (state of an object)

1. The `generate_puzzle` function takes a list of `colors` and the number of `positions` as inputs. It uses the `random.choices` function to generate a random combination of colors with the specified number of positions. The function returns the generated puzzle.

2. The `evaluate_guess` function takes the `puzzle` (the secret code) and the `guess` as inputs. It compares each element of the `guess` with the corresponding element of the `puzzle`. If the positions match, it adds a `*` to the result string. If the color is present in the puzzle but in a different position, it adds an `o` to the result string. Otherwise, it adds a space `' '`. The function returns the result string representing the clues.

3. The `play_game` function takes `colors`, `positions`, and `max_rounds` as inputs. It starts by generating a random puzzle using the `generate_puzzle` function. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the maximum number of rounds is reached.

4. Within each round, the player is prompted to enter their guess using the `input` function. The guess is trimmed to the specified number of positions. The guess is then evaluated using the `evaluate_guess` function, and the resulting clues are printed.

5. If the guess is an exact match to the puzzle (indicated by `clue == '*' * positions`), the player wins and a congratulatory message is printed along with the number of rounds taken to solve the puzzle. The function then returns.

6. If the maximum number of rounds is reached without the player solving the puzzle, a game-over message is printed along with the correct puzzle combination.

7. Finally, the `play_game` function is called with the specified `colors`, `positions`, and `max_rounds` to start the game.
